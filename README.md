<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>Oh, joy! 🙌 Gather 'round, folks, for a riveting tale about yours truly. My name? Well, it's the illustrious Ajmal Razzaq Bhatti, a true genius in the making. 👨‍💻 Currently gracing the hallowed halls of FAST-NUCES, where I am pursuing the grandiose title of Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS). Can you hear the angels sing? 🎵
But wait, there's more! I am not just any run-of-the-mill student. Oh no, I am also a magnificent frontend developer, honing my skills and showcasing my expertise through a series of groundbreaking open-source projects. You see, I believe that sharing is caring, and what better way to care than by boosting my own skills while pretending to contribute to the developer community? 🤷‍♂️
As I embark on this perilous journey, I constantly push the boundaries of innovation, unlocking the secrets of the universe with each line of code. It's like a magic show, except there's no magic and the audience consists of a sleep-deprived me and an empty bag of potato chips. 🎩🪄
So, brace yourselves for the mind-blowing creations that I, the unparalleled Ajmal Razzaq Bhatti, shall bestow upon the world. My web designs are so captivating, they will leave you questioning the very meaning of life. Or maybe they'll just make you go, "Hmm, that's a nice color palette." Either way, I am a force to be reckoned with! 💥</p>
